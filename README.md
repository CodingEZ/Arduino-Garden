# Weed-Detection

The following program detects weeds and plants, implementing OpenCV to threshold and find the edges of green objects.
As of right now, the largest object is considered a plant while any other object above a certain size is considered a weed.
One of the advantages of this program is that it performs under a range (albeit small) of lighting conditions.
However, one of the disadvantages of using this program is that it does not implement any kind of machine learning.
I aim to add in the future a neural network to identify plants regardless of size.
